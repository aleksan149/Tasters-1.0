# Playing the game


Story:

This is a fun game like "egg-kissing".
This story is about two brothers tasters. Jim and James are professional tasters, but they work in completely different social strata ...) Who will you be? A rich sommelier or a homeless man in the trash? The choice is yours!) Eat only edible items!
  The main thing is to perform the tasting on time!

Controls:

Use the keyboard arrows to control the character. SPACE is a choice in the menu or a burp in the game.
